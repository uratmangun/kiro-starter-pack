description: Analyzes the spec structure in .kiro/specs folder and updates PITCH/SPECS.txt with insights on spec-driven development
---
Analyze the files in .kiro/specs folder to understand how specs are structured for Kiro to implement. Create or update PITCH/SPECS.txt with your findings, focusing on:
1. The overall structure of specs (requirements, design, tasks, etc.)
2. How the specs are organized to guide implementation
3. How the spec-driven approach improves the development process
4. Examples of effective spec patterns found in the files
5. Recommendations for spec-driven development

Include specific examples from the specs to illustrate your points. Format the document in a clear, professional manner with appropriate sections and headings.
