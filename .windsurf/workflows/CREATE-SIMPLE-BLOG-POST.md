description: Creates a simple blog post about the project by analyzing its structure, features, and purpose
---
This workflow analyzes your project and generates a simple blog post highlighting its key features, tech stack, and purpose.

1. **Analyze project structure**: Examine the project files to understand the tech stack and architecture by finding key files like package.json, README.md, and source code files.

2. **Read project README**: Extract project information from README if it exists, otherwise generate blog post from project analysis.

3. **Check package.json for dependencies**: Identify the tech stack from package.json by looking for popular frameworks and libraries like react, vue, angular, svelte, next, nuxt, vite, webpack, tailwind, typescript, supabase, firebase, mongodb, postgres.

4. **Analyze project type**: Determine if it's a web app, API, CLI tool, etc. based on file structure and dependencies.

5. **Create blog post**: Generate a comprehensive blog post with the following structure:

# Building [PROJECT_NAME]: A Journey Through Code

*Published on [CURRENT_DATE]*

## Introduction
Brief introduction about the project and its purpose.

## What is [PROJECT_NAME]?
Description based on README or project analysis - describe the project's purpose and main functionality.

## Tech Stack & Architecture
List of technologies found in the project:
- Frontend/UI technologies
- Backend/Database technologies  
- Development Tools

## Key Features
1. **Feature 1**: Describe a key feature
2. **Feature 2**: Describe another feature
3. **Feature 3**: Describe additional functionality

## Development Challenges & Solutions
### Challenge 1: Technical Challenge
**Problem**: Describe the problem
**Solution**: Describe how you solved it

### Challenge 2: Architecture Decision
**Problem**: Describe the decision point
**Solution**: Explain your approach

## What I Learned
- Technical Learning: What new technologies or concepts you learned
- Best Practices: Development practices you adopted
- Problem Solving: How you approached complex problems

## Future Plans
- Add new features
- Improve performance
- Expand functionality

## Getting Started
Installation and setup instructions based on project type.

## Conclusion
Summary of the development experience and key takeaways.

## Technical Deep Dive
### Project Structure
List key source files and their purposes.

### Key Dependencies
List main dependencies from package.json.

### Development Workflow
Describe the development process.

6. **Save the blog post** as BLOG.md in the PITCH folder.

The blog post should be comprehensive, professional, and ready for customization and publishing.
