I'll help you create a new project from the kiro-starter-pack template. Please provide a name for your new project, and I'll guide you through the process of:

1. Cloning the template repository from https://github.com/uratmangun/kiro-starter-pack
2. Setting up the new project with your chosen name
3. Initializing the project structure
4. Configuring any necessary settings
