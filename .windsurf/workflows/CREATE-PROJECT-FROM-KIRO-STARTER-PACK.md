description: Automatically creates a new project using the kiro-starter-pack GitHub template
---
I'll help you create a new project from the kiro-starter-pack GitHub template using the GitHub CLI. Please provide a name for your new project, and I'll execute the following steps:

1. Use `gh repo create` with the template flag to create a new repository from https://github.com/uratmangun/kiro-starter-pack
2. Clone the newly created repository to your local machine
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Initialize any necessary project settings
5. Provide next steps for project setup

The command I'll use: `gh repo create [your-project-name] --template uratmangun/kiro-starter-pack --clone --public`

What would you like to name your new project? (This will be used as both the repository name and local directory name)
