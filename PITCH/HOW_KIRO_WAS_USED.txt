Kiro AI automated this project through 12 agent hooks for README generation, git commits, license creation, and pitch documentation. Steering rules enforced Fish shell usage and Supabase deployment patterns. Cross-platform workflow conversion between Kiro hooks and Windsurf workflows enabled seamless AI-assisted development. Automated documentation generation saved hours of manual work while maintaining consistent project standards and conventional commit formatting.
