Kiro specs follow a structured 3-document approach: requirements.md defines what to build, design.md outlines technical architecture, and tasks.md tracks implementation progress. This spec-driven development ensures full context before coding, prevents duplication, maintains consistency, and validates against acceptance criteria. Specs live in .kiro/specs/[feature-name]/ and must be read completely before starting any related work.
